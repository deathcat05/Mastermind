Everything *should* work EXCEPT the ability for a user guessing up to 8 times. Currently, the user will be able to click any row, and it will populate all corresponding circles in all 8 rows the exact same. 

Clicking on the reset circle will reset the game.
If a user correctly guesses all circles, it will provide an alert. 
If the user doesn't correctly guess, it just maintains the state.
